Abstract.The objective of machine learning study for landslides are to predict the occurrence of landslide
events as well as to identify several parameters which influence the landslide susceptibility. The study 
area is in the Northern End of the Longmenshan Fault, Sichuan Province, China. In this study, the authors 
used both the IBM SPSS program and the python language program to analyze and model the data 
provided. In data preparation, several steps are performed including data cleaning, aspect 
transformation, lithology separation, factor of safety (fos) classification, transformation, and 
normalization. To test the model accuracy, data partition was applied. The main modeling technique 
performed with SPSS software including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network 
and KNN with additional logistic regression, K-Means, and PCA which run in python. Models are
evaluated by using the confusion matrix with precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy to help determine 
the most suitable model. In general, all models with an accuracy score of more than 0.8, could be used 
to analyzed landslide susceptibility. Based on the analysis of data provided; scarps distance, specific 
weight, and lithology of moraine play the major roles for landslide susceptibility.
